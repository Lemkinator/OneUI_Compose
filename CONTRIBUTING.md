# How to contribute
Simply fork the project, make some commits and open a pull request like usually.

## Guidelines
While its great to keep the official [kotlin style conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#horizontal-whitespace) in mind, these are not mandatory.
Just try to keep your code clean and readable.

## Component structure
When implementing a simple to medium sized component, please try to follow the unified structure as best as possible.

For a components, following parts should be seperated:
- Colors (Color data class and color composable function)
- Default spects (Defaults object)
- Core composable
- Core overloads
- Helper functions/composables

# Themes
## Colors

The library ships four predefined `OneUIColorTheme`s:

- `DarkColorTheme`: The default colors in dark mode
- `LightColorTheme`: The default colors in light mode
- `DynamicLightColorTheme`: The colors in light mode, adapting to dynamic colors
- `DynamicDarkColorTheme`: The colors in dark mode, adapting to dynamic colors.

The dynamic color themes read the colors from a autogenerated colors.xml file. This is necessary, as dynamic colors work by replacing color xml values. Due to a bug, these dynamic colors currently only work partly. 

The normal color themes are autogenerated as well.

Contributing to either of these four files is **not** recommended.

The original colors were pulled from the [OneUI Library for Android XML](https://github.com/OneUIProject)
